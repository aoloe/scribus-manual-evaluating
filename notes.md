## How good is Scribus compared with professional tools like InDesign, Affinity Publisher, or Microsoft Publisher?

This is a question that should have a general structured answer.

One that starts with: it depends on your skills and on what you plan to do with Scribus.

Here is a random list of personal thoughts on how good Scribus is:

- Scribus is a professional tool, in the same league as the first two you're mentioning. For many criteria it is fighting against relegation (the third tool is not in the same league and is scheduled for disappearing). A good example of professional work done with Scribus has been posted recently in this forum: https://www.blender.org/news/blender-foundation-annual-report-2024/
- Scribus works well for long term repeating jobs (e.g. publishing a magazine), where an expert sets up a template and defines a workflow tailored on Scribus' features.
- Scribus works well for smaller jobs, without a very high time constraint.
- Scribus clearly shows its limits on big projects with a tight time budget, varying inputs and output, and high "design expectations" (a magazine with random contributions and a always changing graphical elements)
- For longer documents, Scribus is good at creating PDF for print but not digital ones (no links, little optimization of file size)
- Scribus does not have any accessibility features (in the output; not really surprising, since it is still very oriented towards print jobs)
- Printers will always have issues when printing your PDFs: but while they know by heart the Indesign shortcomings, they tend to just send back PDFs that don't conform to their expectations, when they know it's done with Scribus (even if they might conform to the specifications they gave).
- Scribus does not support the flattening of transparencies (while current PDF versions tend to support transparencies, many printer will tell you to provide PDFs in those version, but without transparencies).
- Scribus PDFs are of very good quality.
- Scribus can import files from PDF and InDesign (in the InDesign .idml export format) but it won't be a 100% match (so no back and forth)
- Scribus does not always works well when files are on shared volumes.
- Scribus does not allow any collaborative work on its files. Also, if multiple users edit the same file at different time, the path to the file itself and to the images needs to stay the same (there are workaround through the "Collect for output" but they are a bit tedious).
- Scribus does not yet correctly support most non "latin" languages. On the other side, available features are there for all users and not only for some regions.
- Scribus tries to provide general workflow solutions, rather than complex features tailored to specific workflows (sometimes you need to use multiple tools and a few more clicks, instead of just triggering a single command: but it's then easier to combine the tools to do what you want (instead of looking for exceptions in the simplified command)
- With a bit (or rather a lot) of patience you can shape Scribus to be a tool that better fits your needs!
- Scribus cannot (yet!) correctly / efficiently import all relevant formatting from text documents (it recognizes most of them, but has some shortcoming in the way it handles them)

Voil√†, I guess that it would be nice to have similar insights from other people using Scribus and produce a document that lists the pro and contra of Scribus (with ways to handle the contra : - )
