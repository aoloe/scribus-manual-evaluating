# Evaluating Scribus

TODO: We need a better title. It's not about learning to use Scribus, but about checking if Scribus fits the reader's needs.

## Introduction

This document started as a reaction to [a post in the Scribus Forum](https://forums.scribus.net/index.php/topic,4778.msg22014.html) complaining about nearly every aspect of Scribus.  
Not in details, just about the feeling.

We don't want you to have a similar experience and we clarify:

- What is Scribus.
- What Scribus does for you.
- How to get Scribus.
- How to install and configure Scribus.
- Some Scribus fundamentals.

And finally we will show you how to do your first steps with Scribus. But you can also start from the last part of this document, try things out and see yourself if it suits your needs.

This document does not teach to efficiently use Scribus: it just tries to avoid that people get stuck and angry while evaluating it!

### The original complaint

On December, 7 2023, [abrogard wrote to the Scribus forums](https://forums.scribus.net/index.php/topic,4778.msg22014.html):

First off [Scribus] just looked like MS draw or something.
then I tried pasting in some text. didn't work.
then i opened a text box and tried again. didn't work
then i 'inserted' and a whole file came in.
so then i tried to embolden a heading. 
didn't work.
then i googled and found that won't work. got to select a different font.
now's a good time, I think, for me to get a 'heads up'
what do I want this for?
which software is it an immediate improvement on?  which thing has it 'done better than they do'?
or if you like: which costly software does it do the same as but free?
or which need does it address that currently isn't met?

not arguing with it, you understand? not trying to put it down at all.  just simply trying to get it straight what i'm into here.  so's i don't ask what it perhaps can't deliver and perhaps was never meant to deliver.

Must admit I do very little 'desktop publishing'  mainly I do it when I have to send formatted submissions to my online school.  I find Word and Libre Office often quite bloody annoying there. Improvement on that would be good.
